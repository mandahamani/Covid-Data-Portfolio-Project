# Covid-Data-Portfolio-Project
A data exploration project on Covid vaccination and death data using SQL Server.

# Overview
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my data exploration skills in Microsoft SQL Server. Some data cleaning was also carried out in Excel to organise the data, making it more manageable to work with in SQL. I used functions such as Max, Cast, Sum, Partition, CTE, Drop Table, Inset Into, Create Table, Create View, Join, Substring.
